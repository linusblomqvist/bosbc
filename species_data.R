1940s in District C. Some records since then may pertain to escaped birds,

<p class=BodyA>The Fulvous Whistling-Duck appeared fairly regularly along the
South Coast through the first half of the 1900s. Dawson (1923) wrote that
“during migration, it is regular in Santa Barbara in both early May and late
August.” Records from this period include: Goleta 13 September 1911, 9 or 10 at
Carpinteria Salt Marsh 2 May 1912 (ph. Bent 1923, Dawson 1923), vic. Santa
Barbara 16 August 1913 and 5 May 1915 (Dawson 1916), 3 in Santa Barbara 1–7
March 1917, 2 at Carpinteria Salt Marsh 24 April 1920, 7 in Santa Barbara 6–10
May 1920, 2 in Santa Barbara 19 September 1929, 4&nbsp;at Carpinteria Salt
Marsh 15 August 1941, and Santa Barbara 14 August 1942.</p>

<p class=BodyA>Records of birds since the mid-1900s (all with uncertain origins
to a varying degree) are: Carpinteria Salt Marsh 9 January 1963; Lake Los
Carneros 10–11 February 1970; Goleta Slough 3 October 1973; Santa Maria River
mouth 18 May 1980; Devereux Slough 17–26 November 1981 (ph. SBMNH); Goleta
sewage treatment plant 1 December 2005–30 March 2006 (ph. <span class=None><i>NAB</i></span>
60:283, SBMNH), and Lake Los Carneros and Goleta sewage treatment plant 9
April–7 July 2018 (ph. SBMNH). The 2005–2006 bird occurred during an apparent
small incursion of Fulvous Whistling-Ducks to Southern California and Arizona.</p>",
    "<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:\"Times\",serif;color:black'>Rare
fall transient and winter visitor in District C, where casual in spring and
summer; very rare in District I and casual in Districts M and V. Four records
of blue-morph individuals.</span></i></p>

<p class=BodyA>Snow Geese frequent lakes, ponds, sloughs, river mouths, and wet
pastures. Fall migrants (November–December) arrive as early as late October
(earliest arrival dates: 11+ October 2007 Santa Maria, 13 October 2007 Goleta,
and 14 October 1997 Santa Ynez River mouth and behind Santa Barbara (10–12)).
Most of the recent fall and winter records involve single individuals or small
flocks of up to 15 individuals, with typically several such reports annually;
larger counts are of a flock of 25 over Santa Barbara 1 November 1991, 25 birds
west of Goleta 13 January 1998, 35 in Goleta 19 November 2000, and 30 on the
Santa Maria–Guadalupe CBC 23 December 2012 (and see below). Six sitting on the
ocean ca. 10 mi (16 km) off Carpinteria 16 November 1989 were in atypical habitat.
Winter visitants have remained to the beginning of April, casually later still
(e.g., through 13 April 2021 Goleta (5), through 23 April 2023 Santa Barbara, through
26 April 2013 Goleta, through 2 May 2003 Santa Barbara, and through 3 May 2021
Santa Barbara). Probable late spring migrants were in Goleta 21 April 2001, at
the Santa Ynez River mouth through 28 April 2006, in Goleta 25 April–20 May
2008 and 6–14 April 2017, and (tame) Santa Barbara Bird Refuge 28 March–23
April 2023.</p>

<p class=BodyA>One individual first noted at the Santa Barbara (Andree Clark)
Bird Refuge 19 March 1977 became quite tame and was last seen in late May;
other tame birds were there from 30 November 1988–2 May 1989 and at Waller Park
in Santa Maria from October 2007–April 2015.</p>

<p class=BodyA>This species was once a common winter visitor on the Channel
Islands (e.g., Santa Rosa Island) through the early 1900s. A record of 18 in
Santa Barbara 1 March 1920, with 6&nbsp;still present on 6 May, reflects this
earlier abundance.</p>

<p class=BodyA>Most of the records from District I come from the Lake Cachuma
area (including foraging birds up to several miles away near Santa Ynez), with
14 there 27 December 2000 and up to 11 present late November 1991–early
February 1992 the highest counts; up to 92 near Santa Ynez 1 December 2006–19
January 2007 is the largest count for the entire county. The earliest arrival
in District I is 20 October 2001 Lake Cachuma. In addition, 3 were over the
Mono Creek area 31 January 1937, and 1 was near Solvang 28 January 2012.</p>

<p class=BodyA>In District M, a flock of 50 flew over Figueroa Mountain 21
February 1989.</p>

<p class=BodyA>There are just three records from District V: 6&nbsp;Cuyama
Valley 16 November 1985, 1 near New Cuyama 15 January 2011, and 1 there 19–28
November 2011.</p>

<p class=BodyA>There are four county records of blue-morph individuals (“Blue
Goose”): Storke Ranch, Goleta, 12 November 2002, Glen Annie Golf Course,
Goleta, 24–30 December 2006 (ph. SBMNH), Guadalupe 30 December 2011, and Santa
Ynez River mouth 1–13 February 2017.</p>

<p class=BodyA>One bird banded in the Northwest Territories 30 July 1988 was
recovered in Santa Barbara County 14 January 1989.</p>
